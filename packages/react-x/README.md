Cross-platform React components for ReactDOM and React Native.

## Getting Started

Install `react-x` using `yarn`:

```shell
yarn add react-x
```

## Setup

### React Native

No additional setup required for react-native.

### React DOM

If using Webpack, you need to add the `.dom.js` extension to the extensions array.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  resolve: {
    extensions: ['.dom.js', '.js', '.json'],
  },
};
```
